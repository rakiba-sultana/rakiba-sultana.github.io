Hi, I’m **Rakiba Sultana**!  
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Dept. of Geosciences, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.  
My research focuses on understanding **contaminant transport mechanisms in the vadose zone and groundwater during flooding events**.

I assimilate **analytical lab tehcniques, environmental data science, groundwater modeling, and field-based experiments** into my research.
