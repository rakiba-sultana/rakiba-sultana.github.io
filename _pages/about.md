Hi, I’m **Rakiba Sultana**!  
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Hydrogeology at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.  
My research focuses on understanding **contaminant transport mechanisms during flooding events**.

I am also passionate about **environmental data science, groundwater modeling, and field-based experiments**.

You can read more about my work on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/).
